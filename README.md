Treehouse Unit 5 Project

Collects random mock-data of 12 people from a public API.

Processes data into 12 cards displayed on the screen. 

Opens modal upon clicking any of the 12 cards. Next and previous buttons browse through the current, active, cards.
Next button is disabled when last active card is reached and previous button is disabled when first card is reached.
Modal has a functional close button that deletes the modal coding from the HTML.

Search bar filters cards by the entered value on enter or click of submit button. 

Color theme is changed in CSS, as well as the font of h1. 
Sizing of h1 and the searchbar is changed and cards' border-radius is changed.
